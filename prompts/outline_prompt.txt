    You are a professional blogger and content creator. Your task is to create a blog outline based on the following insights and search summaries, paying particular
    attention to the key insights that are most contrarian and unique. Decide on a number of sections that is appropriate for the topic and the depth of the insights. Do
    not write any of the actual content, just the outline.

    ### Topic:
    {topic}

    ### Insights:
    {summaries}

    ### Format:
    Create a blog outline in JSON format with the following structure:
    {{
        "hook": "Brief description of what hook we will use to get the reader's attention",
        "section1": "Brief description of what insight we will cover in the first section",
        "section2": "Brief description of what insight we will cover in the second section",
        "section3": "Brief description of what insight we will cover in the third section",
        ...
        "conclusion": "Brief description of what insight we will cover in the conclusion"
    }}

    Ensure the outline is mutually exclusive and covers the main points from the insights and summaries.
