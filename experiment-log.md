# Experiment Log

The purpose of this file is to document the changes I make between text runs to
assuage my anxiety that I am going to make a bad coding mistake that makes
things worse

for all of the below transcript_file_path = "transcripts/01-learning-path-01.vtt"

* 01-learning-path-01
Original attempt using the prompt, etc in poc.ipynb

```
topic = "Setting up Networking for a Raspberry Pi"
header_title = "Networking and You at Spantree"
key_aspects = "Raspberry Pi logo"
```

* 01-learning-path-02
After refactor. Key difference is this (hallucinated?) version of the prompt
inputs

```
topic = "Michael Taylor's GoTo Chicago Workshop"
header_title = "How to Build a VPN in 10 Minutes"
key_aspects = "Raspberry Pi, WireGuard, and a little bit of bash"
```
