# Next Steps

This is a place for me to channel my anxiety by documenting next steps "if I
only had more time", etc...

## Prompt Engineering Next Steps

* ~~Be super organized with named prompts and the like~~
* Use the outline from zoom not the insights + outline prompts output if
  available.
* Mess with the prompts, either to improve the quality or to add features, like
  inline code blocks.
* Mess with the temperature of the query to see if more chaos makes it more
  intelligent.

## Technical Next steps

* Replatform into typescript to make it easier to write code for
* ~~Replatform into *.py files to make it easier to run over and over~~
* Try with a spantree project, for the purpose of explaining what we do or what
  we've done in the past, either from the client directly or from the team
  members that worked on it. It could be part of the files of a private client
  briefing to help the sales team understand the tech involved. If we had all of
  them consolodated we could have chatGPT query past projects and work.
