# Next Steps

This is a place for me to channel my anxiety by documenting next steps "if I
only had more time", etc...

## Prompt Engineering Next Steps

* ~~Be super organized with named prompts and the like~~
* Use the outline from zoom not the insights + outline prompts output if
  available.
* Mess with the prompts, either to improve the quality or to add features, like
  inline code blocks.
* Mess with the temperature of the query to see if more chaos makes it more
  intelligent.

## Technical Next steps

* Replatform into typescript to make it easier to write code for
* ~~Replatform into *.py files to make it easier to run over and over~~
